# TODO

Remaining TODO items for this Android app.

## Pre release

- Finish README.md (link to app store)
- Ensure that the remaining documentation is online (and email to Warrick)
- Sanity check


## UI

- Change the introduction text to something more useful
- Get Warrick to test on a tablet
- Keep the screen on while entering data?
- "Outlier detected" message needs improving - actionable?

### UX or discoverability

- Message formatting/text sizes (visibility?)
- Provide some feedback for scrolling down for messages
- Animating new items appearing/reset would be nice

### Keyboard

- Rotating the screen might re-extend the keyboard (elements regain focus)
- Keyboard does not vanish on tap-off
- Custom keyboard


## Refactor

- General code cleanup
- Add more comments and fix/update existing
- Fix the TODO's in the code...
- Clean up the calculation code


## Other

- Tests (check against database data, unit and ui tests)
  - Sarah has spreadsheet data for the tests
- Add support for importing/exporting data (from a clipboard? another app?)
- Implement young crop support
- Region-specific models
- "Who is Sarah Sinton" - note who the mentioned people are
