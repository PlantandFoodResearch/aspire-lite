# Aspire Asparagus Lite

This android app is designed to help asparagus farmers make crop management
decisions, for instance when to stop harvesting.
It uses Brix readings gathered from the roots of the asparagus plants to
determine an estimated CHO level, and from that can give a recommendation on
the plant state.

See the help menu in the app for details.

Feel free to send a pull request with improvements!
If you would rather re-release the app yourself, ensure that you have removed
all branding.

There are currently no long-term plans by Plant and Food to maintain this
codebase, so you may need to poke a few people to check its status.
